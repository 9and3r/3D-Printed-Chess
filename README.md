# 3D-Printed-Chess

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Material list
This is the main material used to make this project. You should be able to replace the components for similar ones. For example, a Raspberry Pi 1/2 should work but it has not been tested. You should be able to buy the components where you want. The buy link is the site were I purchased the components.
